## or: how to bring monochromatic paintings to the 21st century

Monochromatic paintings are often puzzling for art viewers and artists alike: what is the meaning ? why is it interesting ?

Some says it is to explore the colours themselves; others answers, the brushes strokes that you can see on the painting.

Personally speaking, I find them meditative - quietly mesmerizing. I see them as a physical interpretation of a human performance - that is, painting.

I find them focused: there is nothing to take you away from where you are, you are into the moment as the painting is in front of you.

This is why I thought that they would make a great meditative app-game - extremely low-tech game.

Since there are no brush strokes involved... no movement to consider... why would the game be playable ?

### information about the piece

The code was written late at night, before the [Boston Hackathon for Terrible Ideas](https://bostonstupidhackathon.com/).

It was then submitted to [Le DÃ©potoir](https://le-depotoir.itch.io/) 30 min jam, during which I wrote the first draft of this essay.
